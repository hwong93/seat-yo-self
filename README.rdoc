== README

Seat-yo-self was the first bitmaker group project. The goal of the project was to be an opentable clone, where users can reserve seats at different restaurants. This project was meant to further solidify the concepts of validations, models, controllers, authentication and working together in a team.

== Things to add:
1. Improve CSS, using REACT or Angular
2. Add some more tests using MiniTest or Factorygirl gem
3. Change the map to javascript and not-static
4. Fix validations and forms so users can't even input wrong values.
